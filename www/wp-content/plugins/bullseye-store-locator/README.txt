== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I login to Wordpress or Bullseye to update my locations and make edits to my locator? =

Updates to the locations and look of the locator occur inside the [Bullseye admin](https://app.bullseyelocations.com), which is a separate login from your Wordpress login.

= How do I get my locations into Bullseye? =

Most often, companies [upload](https://app.bullseyelocations.com/Admin/Locations/Import.aspx) their locations in a .csv file in the Bullseye admin. To use this option, the format must be .csv.  If you only have a few locations to add, you can login to the Bullseye admin and type them into a form.  

With a Web Premium subscription, it is possible to automate the updates.  If you subscribe to Salesforce.com’s Enterprise Edition, we have an adapter that updates directly from your Salesforce.com account.  We can also automate from other CRM/ERP systems.  Contact us for more info on location automation.

= How involved is it to get Bullseye on my Wordpress page? =

It’s very easy.  When you sign up for a trial account, there is an option to add a Wordpress locator, which creates a page for the locator, and embeds our locator on your page.  Edits to our interface can be done directly in the Bullseye admin, without a need to reinstall on your Wordpress page. Coding experience is not necessary.

= How do I add a store locator page in Wordpress? =

To embed the locator in your Wordpress page, copy and paste the shortcode provided (see the Admin panel) into the location where you want your locator to display.

= What if I want a custom locator? =

With a Web Premium subscription, you get API access which allows you to write your own custom locator, instead of using our standard Wordpress interface.  We also offer integration services if you don’t have resources to create your own custom interface.

= How does your support work? =

We offer phone, chat, and email support.  We pride ourselves on being available, helpful, and quick with our response.  If you have an issue, you can contact us any of the 3 ways and you will get a timely response.

= Can you explain how your Lead Management services works with Bullseye? =

Lead Management is a service that can be added to a Web Premium subscription (contact us for pricing).  In addition, or in place of the traditional zip code-based store locator, you can provide a lead form for users to fill out.  The user fills out the form, and their info goes to a location via an email.  The location can follow up with the lead, and mark the lead as followed up, so manufacturers and other types of businesses can monitor the follow up of the leads, and market to the leads in the future.  Contact us for a demo.
